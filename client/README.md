# Substrata [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shaunchurch/Substrata.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shaunchurch/Substrata) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/shaunchurch/Substrata.png)](https://gemnasium.com/shaunchurch/Substrata)


A lightweight, minimalist, responsive, semantic grid powered, unstyled, front-end boilerplate with skeleton build and deployment tools. 

## What is it?

Another front-end bare-bones blank-canvas boilerplate.

## What is it for?
When you think, "I just need to build a quick, simple website."

## How to use it

	$ git clone https://github.com/shaunchurch/Substrata.git my-new-project
	$ cd my-new-project
	$ npm install
	$ bower install
	$ grunt server

â€¦then craft your mark-up, compose your content, or code your design.

## Ok, but what does it include?

Don't reinvent the wheel. Code is included from or inspired by HTML5 Boilerplate, Semantic Grid, LESS Hat, and others, then we bundle a set of carefully chosen defaults. There's a Gruntfile with some essential tasks to handle file watching and live reload, compilation and minification of Less & CSS, Javascript, Markdown, plus quick static site/blog generation using Jade templates with layouts and partials support, powered by grunt-pages.

It's almost everything you need to begin working efficiently on the unique parts of a project right away, without needing to spend time downloading frameworks, copying boilerplate code or configuring time-saving build processes.
