I&#39;d like to take a minute -- just sit right there -- I&#39;ll tell you how I became the Prince of a town called Bel Air.</p>\n<p>In West Philadelphia, born and raised, on a playground is where I spent most of my days. Chillin&#39; out maxin&#39; relaxin&#39; all cool and all shootin&#39; some B Ball outside of the school when a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighbourhood. I got in one little fight and my Mom got scared, she said, &quot;You&#39;re moving with your Auntie and Uncle in Bel Air.&quot;</p>\n<p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said &quot;Fresh&quot; and it had dice in the morror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, &quot;Nah, forget it - yo, home to Bel Air&quot;.</p>\n<p>I pulled up to then house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabbie, &quot;Yo, Homes, smell ya later!&quot;, I looked at my kingdom. I was finally there to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.</p>\n","url":"post/and-now-for-something-completely-different","dest":"dist/post/and-now-for-something-completely-different.html"}]}
