Now this is a post all about how my life got flipped turned upside down. I'd like to take a minute -- just sit right there -- I'll tell you how I became the Prince of a town called Bel Air.

In West Philadelphia, born and raised, on a playground is where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool and all shootin' some B Ball outside of the school when a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighbourhood. I got in one little fight and my Mom got scared, she said, "You're moving with your Auntie and Uncle in Bel Air."

I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the morror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, "Nah, forget it - yo, home to Bel Air".

I pulled up to then house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo, Homes, smell ya later!", I looked at my kingdom. I was finally there to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.
